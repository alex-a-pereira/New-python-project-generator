# Python VirtualEnv Generator with GUI - Windows
This program automates the pipenv virtual environment creation process, and wraps the commands into a neat, simple GUI. This was intended for quick personal use. 

## Getting Started
Simply clone the repository to your computer. Make sure that your python executable is in your PATH environmental variable as it's needed to run the script. Please note that this program can only be used on windows at this time. 

## Prerequisites
The program requires no addition packages above the standard library at this time. However, it has not been tested on any version of python besides 3.6. I cannot safely say whether other versions of python are supported at this time.
```
Python 3.6+
```

## Installing
The program requires no formal installation. Simply clone the repository and run through command line/powershell.

## Contributing
If you've come across this repository and would like to contribute to this program, I'm happy to collaborate. This was designed as a quick project to automate a redundant task, but I'd love to see it grow. Feel free to reach out through my contact info in the Authors section below.

## Future Plans
* Integrate git functionality so the following will be automatically copied from an assets folder:
```
* Initilized .git directory
* GitHub remote repo integration
```
