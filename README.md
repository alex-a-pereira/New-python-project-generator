Project's purpose:

    On Windows systems only, I use this script to automate the creation of project
    directories along with virtual environments.

Install / Run:

    Clone, open command line, navigate to the directory that you clone the repo into, and run main.py as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/alex-pereira/New-python-project-generator.git

    open command line

    cd ***PATH\THAT\YOU\CLONED\REPO***
    python main.py

Known issues:

    I suck at coding

Future plans:

    Integrate git functionality so the following will be automatically generated:
    1. an initilized .git directory
    2. a .gitignore specific to python
    3. a README.md
